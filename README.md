# The-Youmu-Project

This project is a custom Personal Assistant using Python. Mainly created to study and learn programming.

The main goal of this project is to create a program that would run in the background of my phone and computer and manage schedules, lists, notes, etc.

## Konpaku Youmu

Konpaku Youmu (魂魄 妖夢) is a character in the videogame Touhou. I just like her name.
